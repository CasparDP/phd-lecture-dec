# PhD Lecture: Firm Websites as a Data Source for Accounting Research

## Overview
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Structure**: Part 1 (40-50 min) + Part 2 (50-60 min)
- **Objective**: Introduce website data methodology, demonstrate application, brainstorm novel research combining classic earnings management setting with new data source

---

## Part 1: Three Papers (30-45 minutes)

### 1. Haans & Mertens (2024) - "The Internet Never Forgets" (10 min)
**Focus**: Method + Data Quality
- Wayback Machine + web scraping methodology
- CompuCrawl database (11,277 firms, 1996-2020)
- **Critical issues**: 20% missing data, survivorship bias, coverage patterns
- **Takeaway**: Powerful data source with serious quality constraints

### 2. Boulland et al. (2025) - "Company Websites: A New Measure of Disclosure" (15 min)
**Focus**: Disclosure Measurement + Validation
- Website-based disclosure measure (size + content)
- Validation: 0.12-0.30 correlations with traditional measures
- Applications: private firms, ESG mandates
- **Devil's advocate moment**: Low correlation = capturing something new OR noisy measure?
- **Takeaway**: Complements traditional measures but validity questions remain

### 3. Jones (1991) - "Earnings Management During Import Relief Investigations" (15 min)
**Focus**: Regulatory Setting + Research Design
- ITC import relief process and injury determination
- Firms manage earnings DOWN during investigations (unusual incentive)
- Jones model for discretionary accruals
- Multi-audience problem (ITC, investors, creditors, employees)
- **Bridge to Part 2**: "Jones 1991 = no websites. Today = rich web presence during investigations."
- **Cliffhanger**: "Could we combine these?"

## Part 2: Research Brainstorming (50-70 minutes)

Phase 1: Idea Presentation (30 min)

- What would Jennifer Jones do today?
- Walkthrough playground: Revisiting Jones (1991)
- Discuss research design choices, challenges, data needs
- Introduce use of AI as RA - Industry matching 

Phase 2: Jone's setting with websites (20-30 min)

- Does website disclosure change during investigations?
- Small group brainstorming: Identify challenges, propose solutions
- Walkthrough playground: Jones + Websites 
- Live demo: Implementing student ideas (preferred)

Phase 3: Wrap-up (10 min)

- Recap key insights from brainstorming
- Discuss next steps for interested students
- Encourage collaboration and idea sharing
- Q&A session - Research design, data, methodology
