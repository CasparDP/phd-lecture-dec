# PhD Lecture: Firm Websites as a Data Source for Accounting Research

## Overview
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Structure**: Part 1 (60-70 min) + Part 2 (50-60 min)
- **Objective**: Introduce website data methodology, demonstrate application, brainstorm novel research combining classic earnings management setting with new data source

---

## Part 1: Three Papers (60-70 minutes)

### 1. Haans & Mertens (2024) - "The Internet Never Forgets" (20 min)
**Focus**: Method + Data Quality
- Wayback Machine + web scraping methodology
- CompuCrawl database (11,277 firms, 1996-2020)
- **Critical issues**: 20% missing data, survivorship bias, coverage patterns
- **Takeaway**: Powerful data source with serious quality constraints

### 2. Boulland et al. (2025) - "Company Websites: A New Measure of Disclosure" (25 min)
**Focus**: Disclosure Measurement + Validation
- Website-based disclosure measure (size + content)
- Validation: 0.12-0.30 correlations with traditional measures
- Applications: private firms, ESG mandates
- **Devil's advocate moment**: Low correlation = capturing something new OR noisy measure?
- **Takeaway**: Complements traditional measures but validity questions remain

### 3. Jones (1991) - "Earnings Management During Import Relief Investigations" (25 min)
**Focus**: Regulatory Setting + Research Design
- ITC import relief process and injury determination
- Firms manage earnings DOWN during investigations (unusual incentive)
- Jones model for discretionary accruals
- Multi-audience problem (ITC, investors, creditors, employees)
- **Bridge to Part 2**: "Jones 1991 = no websites. Today = rich web presence during investigations."
- **Cliffhanger**: "Could we combine these?"

---

## Part 2: Research Brainstorming (50-60 minutes)
<!-- 
### Phase 1: Idea Presentation (10 min)
**Research Question**: Do firms strategically manage website disclosures during import relief investigations?
- Multi-audience signaling problem
- Narrative beyond financial numbers
- Distinguishing real vs. accounting injury

### Phase 2: Structured Critique (30 min)
**Round 1** (15 min): Groups identify problems/challenges
- Sample size, ITC doesn't look at websites, measurement validity, endogeneity, etc.
- Report out

**Round 2** (15 min): Groups propose research design solutions
- How to address identified problems
- Report out

### Phase 3: Reality Check (10 min)
- What data is actually available
- What modern import relief cases exist
- Feasibility: doable vs. ideal

### Phase 4: Fork in the Road (5-10 min)
**Three options**:
- Option A: Collaborative project (co-authorship if 3+ interested)
- Option B: Individual projects (adapt for dissertation)
- Option C: Learning exercise only (still valuable)

**No pressure** - learning objectives achieved regardless -->

## Materials Needed

### Pre-Class
- **Required reading**: All three papers (with section focus guide)
- **Optional**: Students identify one recent import relief case + firm websites

<!-- ### In-Class
- Slide deck with key exhibits from each paper
- Live demo: Wayback Machine interface (5 min)
- Data availability summary: CompuCrawl coverage by industry/year
- Handout: "Research Design Checklist for New Data Sources"

### Post-Class (Optional)
- **Brief assignment** (2 pages, due 1 week):
  - (a) Refined research design for Jones+website idea, OR
  - (b) Alternative research question using website data, OR
  - (c) Critique of website-based research in accounting -->

<!-- ## Database Contribution

**Your value-add**:
- Accounting-specific CompuCrawl extension
- Matched with Compustat financials
- Pre-computed disclosure measures (Boulland methodology)
- Event flags (import relief, SEC investigations, etc.)
- Quality documentation by industry/year

**Positioning**: Students as early users/validators, not just consumers

## Learning Objectives (achieved regardless of project outcome)

1. Methodological training: web scraping, archival data, data quality
2. Critical evaluation: validate new measures, question correlations
3. Research design: identify endogeneity, selection bias, measurement issues
4. Domain knowledge: revisiting classics with new data
5. Creativity: idea to implementation process

## Time Management Notes

- Three papers in 60-70 min is tight
- Send detailed reading guide beforehand
- Use timer to stay disciplined
- Focus on key takeaways, not exhaustive coverage -->
