## About This Lecture

This lecture explores how modern data sources can breathe new life into classic accounting research. We'll examine Jennifer Jones's influential 1991 study on earnings management during import relief investigations, then see how contemporary website data could extend and validate her findings.

The lecture is structured in two parts:

**Part 1: Three Papers** introduces the methodological toolkit and theoretical foundation:

- Overview: Modern web scraping techniques for longitudinal data collection based on @haans2024internet
- Website-based disclosure measures and their validation based on @boulland2025company
- The classic @jones1991earnings earnings management study

**Part 2: Research in Action** demonstrates the research process:

- My interpretation of @jones1991earnings with *modern* methods
- Preliminary exploration of website disclosure patterns during investigations
- Structured critique and discussion of research design choices

Beyond understanding specific methods and findings, this lecture aims to **stimulate your own research creativity**. By engaging with the materials—seeing how papers can be combined, observing the decision-making process, and practicing structured critique—you'll develop pattern recognition for spotting research opportunities. The GitHub repository provides working code and data that you can adapt for your own questions, and the lecture format encourages you to think: "What would I do differently?" or "Where else could this approach work?"

## Learning Goals

This lecture is designed to **spark your own research ideas**:

- **During Part 1:** Ask yourself: "What other classic studies could benefit from website data?"
- **During Part 2:** Think: "What would I do differently? What am I curious about?"
- **After class:** The GitHub materials are yours to adapt, extend, or apply to entirely different questions

The best outcome isn't just understanding *this* project—it's developing your ability to spot opportunities where new data sources can unlock fresh insights into established phenomena. Use the lecture materials as a launching pad for your own creativity.
