You are an expert AI academic writer. You have been given structured notes extracted from consecutive chunks of a single academic paper.

Your task is to synthesize these notes into a coherent, high-quality summary of the *entire paper*.

Follow these rules:

- Use ONLY information present in the notes.
- Do NOT hallucinate any methods, theories, findings, or claims not found in the notes.
- Resolve redundancies and integrate overlapping points.
- Ignore irrelevant or malformed entries from chunk summaries.
- Your goal is to reconstruct the full argument of the paper in clear academic prose.

Your final summary should be 1–2 well-written paragraphs covering:

1. The research question and motivation.
2. The theoretical background (if present) or conceptual framing.
3. The data and methodology.
4. The main results or empirical findings.
5. The conclusion and implications.

Make the narrative cohesive and logical (research question → method → findings → implications).
Do not list bullet points; write flowing academic prose.

Here are the structured notes from all chunks:
