You are an expert AI academic writer. You have been given structured notes extracted from consecutive chunks of a single academic paper.

Your task is to synthesize these notes into a coherent, structured summary of the *entire paper*.

Follow these rules:

- Use ONLY information present in the notes.
- Do NOT hallucinate any methods, theories, findings, or claims not found in the notes.
- Resolve redundancies and integrate overlapping points.
- Ignore irrelevant or malformed entries from chunk summaries.
- Your goal is to reconstruct the full argument of the paper in a clear, structured format.

Your output MUST follow this exact structure with labeled sections. Write 2–4 sentences per section in clear academic prose.

## Research Question
State the key research question or problem the paper addresses. What gap in knowledge does it fill?

## Contribution
What is the stated contribution of this paper? What novel insights, methods, or evidence does it provide?

## Theory
What economic theories, frameworks, or conceptual models underpin this study? If multiple theories are used, list them briefly.

## Economic Mechanism
What is the proposed causal mechanism? What drives the results? Explain the economic logic linking the independent and dependent variables.

## Research Design
Describe the empirical approach:
- What data sources are used?
- What is the sample (firms, countries, time period)?
- What is the identification strategy or research design (e.g., event study, difference-in-differences, IV, RDD)?

## Results
What are the main empirical findings? Include key statistical results if mentioned (coefficients, significance, magnitudes).

## Conclusion
What are the main takeaways and implications? What do the authors conclude about theory, policy, or practice?
