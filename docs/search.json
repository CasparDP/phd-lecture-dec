    "text": "Sample Selection\n\nMatching Import Relief Investigations to Industries and Compustat Firms\nI identify import relief investigations from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) by scraping their Commission Publications Library. My scraping process employs robust retry logic and Cloudflare bypass mechanisms, with raw HTML cached for reproducibility and efficiency. I match investigation titles to standardized industry classifications using a SIC-NAICS crosswalk (1987/1997 versions) enhanced by semantic matching via a local language model. This procedure links (almost) each USITC investigation ID to corresponding SIC and NAICS codes, enabling systematic identification of treatment industries (those under investigation) and control industries (structurally similar but not investigated).

select the nonclassifiable/unclassified category.\n\n\nLarge Residential Washers\nBolts, Nuts, Screws, Rivets, and Washers\n3452\nThe only industry listed that explicitly mentions washers is Bolt, Nut, Screw, Rivet, and Washer Manufacturing, making it the closest match.\n\n\nFresh\nFresh Fruits and Vegetables\n5148\nThe title 'Fresh' directly matches the description of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Wholesalers.\n\n\nFine Denier Polyester Staple Fiber\nBroadwoven Fabric Mills, Manmade Fiber and Silk\n2221\nPolyester staple fiber is a manmade fiber used in broadwoven fabric manufacturing, matching the Broadwoven Fabric Mills industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantSome important caveats about the matching process:\n\n\n\n\nI only use safeguard investigations (not other types of import relief)\nSome investigations could not be matched to a specific SIC code (9999)\nThe matching relies on LLM reasoning which may introduce errors\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting Data\nI obtain financial statement data from Compustat North America for U.S. incorporated firms beginning in 1975. I exclude financial institutions (SIC codes 6000-6999) and require non-missing total assets for all firm-years. To ensure robust industry-specific estimation of the Jones model, I retain only industry-years (three-digit SIC level) with at least 10 observations. I exclude observations with missing values for total accruals, revenue changes, property-plant-equipment, or lagged total assets. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the influence of extreme outliers. For additional implementation details, see the companion R script.\n\n\nTreatment Sample Selection and Event Window Definition\nTo construct my treatment sample, I apply several critical filters to the matched investigations. First, I identify the investigation date and extract both the calendar year and month. To ensure that year_zero captures the last complete fiscal year before the investigation announcement, I adjust for each firm’s fiscal year-end month. Specifically, for firms with fiscal year-end months before the investigation month, their fiscal year statement would have already been reported before the investigation, making that fiscal year “year 0.” For firms with fiscal year-end months after the investigation month, their reported year 0 encompasses the investigation announcement, and I adjust their timing accordingly. Second, I address the issue of multiple investigations in the same industry. Some SIC-3 industries (314, 332, 514) experience multiple import relief investigations within short time windows. To avoid contamination and confounded treatment effects, I retain only the first investigation per SIC-3 industry, excluding subsequent treatments within the same year or immediately following year (diff_year_zero &gt; 1). This design choice prioritizes clean identification of the initial shock at the cost of sample size—a conservative approach that trades statistical power for causal credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OG… Jones Model\n\nJones (1991): Time-Series Firm-Specific Approach\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Total accruals}_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} = \\frac{1}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_1 \\frac{\\Delta REV_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_2 \\frac{PPE_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Total accruals}_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}}\\) = total accruals for firm i at time t\n\\(AT_{i,t-1}\\) = total assets for firm i at time t-1\n\\(\\Delta REV_{it}\\) = change in revenues for firm i at time t\n\\(PPE_{it}\\) = property, plant, and equipment for firm i at time t\n\nJones (1991) estimates a separate regression for each firm using several years of historical data. The estimation period stops in year t-2. Firm-specific coefficients capture each firm’s unique accrual patterns. Compares actual accruals to the firm’s own historical norm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTime-Series Firm-Specific Jones Model\n\n\n\nDiscretionary accruals: \\(\\text{DA}_{it}\\) = residual from firm i’s time-series regression\n\n\n\n\nMy Approach: Cross-Sectional Industry-Specific Approach\nEstimates yearly regressions by SIC-3 industry using all firms in that industry. Industry-year-specific coefficients capture industry norms in each period. Compares firm accruals to industry peers in the same year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantCross-Sectional Industry-Specific Jones Model\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{DA}_{it}\\) = residual from industry-year cross-sectional regression\nImplication: I measure abnormal accruals relative to contemporaneous industry peers, not firm’s historical pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Earnings Management Measurement\n\n\n\nDechow et al. (2010) reviews the literature surrounding “earnings quality,” including earnings management. They discuss trade-offs between time-series and cross-sectional approaches to measuring abnormal accruals. See Gow and Ding (2024) for an in-depth overview of implementing accrual-based earnings management measures—or for practical guidance on many aspects of empirical research in accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked Difference-in-Differences with First-Differenced Specification\nI implement a stacked difference-in-differences (DiD) design to estimate the impact of import relief investigations on discretionary accruals. The treatment group consists of firms in industries subject to import relief investigations, while the control group includes firms in industries without such investigations (different SIC-1 codes). I define event time relative to the investigation year, with t=0 as the investigation year. For each event window (t-2 to t+2), I create a separate dataset stacking observations from treated and control industries; see, e.g., Baker et al. (2022); Baker et al. (2025) for more details on stacked DiD designs.\n\nFirst-Difference DiD Model\n\\[\\Delta \\text{DA}_{it} = \\beta_1Treated_i + \\alpha_{fyear}+ \\gamma_{cohort}+ \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta(DA_{it}) = \\text{DA}_{it} - \\text{DA}_{i,t-1}\\) is the change in discretionary accruals for firm i at time t\n\\(Treated_i\\) is a binary indicator for whether firm i is in the treatment group\n\\(\\alpha_{fyear}\\) are fixed effects for the fiscal year\n\\(\\gamma_{cohort}\\) are fixed effects for the cohort\n\\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is the error term\n\n\n\nWhy?\nThe idea is to present results in a way that is more directly comparable to Jones (1991). She also compares changes in discretionary accruals around the investigation period, specifically in years t-1 to t+1. I want to make my results more directly comparable to hers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOkay, so where’s the DiD?\n\n\n\nDifference #1: Change in discretionary accruals within firms over time.

    "text": "Paper Summary\nResearch Question\nThe paper investigates whether domestic producers that stand to gain from U.S. import relief manipulate earnings during investigations by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). It seeks to fill a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence on earnings management specifically in the context of import‑relief determinations, a setting where managers’ incentives to distort profitability are theoretically strong but rarely tested.\nContribution\nThe study supplies novel evidence that managers deliberately reduce reported earnings through discretionary accruals during ITC investigation periods. It introduces a firm‑specific expectations model that controls for economic conditions, applies it to a large Compustat sample of domestic producers, and demonstrates statistically significant earnings‑management effects across multiple industries.\nTheory\nThe analysis rests on incentive theory: regulators and firms benefit from import relief, and managers of affected firms have a motive to influence the ITC’s injury assessment. The earnings‑management hypothesis posits that managers will lower discretionary accruals during the investigation year to make the firm appear less profitable and thereby increase the likelihood of protection.\nEconomic Mechanism\nImport‑relief decisions are based on industry profitability metrics. By decreasing earnings through discretionary accruals, managers can lower the firm’s reported profitability, making the industry appear more injured and thus more likely to receive tariffs, quotas, or other assistance. This manipulation directly links managerial accounting choices to the outcome of the ITC investigation.\nResearch Design\nThe empirical strategy uses audited financial statements from Compustat (1961‑1985) and ITC filings to identify domestic producers subject to import‑relief investigations. Total accruals are calculated from current assets, liabilities, and depreciation, and nondiscretionary accruals are estimated via an expectations regression on revenue change, PPE, and lagged assets. Discretionary accruals are the residuals, standardized into Vits and Z statistics. The design compares year 0 (the investigation year) to year –1 and year +1, employing portfolio tests by industry to mitigate cross‑sectional correlation.\nResults\nDiscretionary accruals are significantly negative in year 0 across all five industries (overall t = –5.008, p &lt; 0.001). Year –1 shows no significant effect, while year +1 remains negative but insignificant. Z statistics for year 0 range from –3.802 to –3.137, indicating strong earnings‑management activity, with the footwear industry example yielding the most pronounced effect. Average R² of the accrual‑expectations regressions is 0.232, and decile analysis suggests the model remains adequate except for firms with extreme revenue declines.\nConclusion\nThe findings confirm that managers of domestic producers engage in earnings management during ITC investigations to influence import‑relief outcomes. This evidence supports the earnings‑management hypothesis and highlights the need for regulators to scrutinize accruals in injury assessments. The study underscores the importance of robust accounting controls and suggests that policy reforms could mitigate managerial incentives to distort profitability in trade‑policy contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAI Generated Summary\n\n\n\nGenerated by Paper Summarizer using Ollama (Model: gpt-oss:20b)",

    "text": "Paper Summary\nResearch Question\nThe paper investigates whether company websites constitute a meaningful channel for public disclosure and how the extent of website disclosure relates to information asymmetry and capital‑market outcomes. It addresses a gap in the literature that has largely focused on regulatory filings, overlooking the growing use of websites—especially by private firms and for non‑financial information.\nContribution\nThe authors develop a novel, data‑driven measure of website disclosure using historical snapshots from the Wayback Machine. They validate this measure against established proxies (management forecasts, 8‑K word counts, 10‑K file size, disclosure quality) and demonstrate its predictive power for reducing bid‑ask spreads and for attracting private‑equity transactions. The study also maps website content into substantive categories (PSP, IR, geography, HR) and explores determinants of disclosure for both public and private firms.\nTheory\nThe analysis rests on disclosure and signaling theory: firms disclose information to reduce asymmetry and signal quality to investors and other stakeholders. Recent evidence that U.S. firms substitute EDGAR filings with website content since 2008 underpins the theoretical expectation that richer website disclosure should improve market efficiency. The categorization of website content reflects the idea that firms tailor information to the informational needs of distinct audiences (customers, investors, regulators).\nEconomic Mechanism\nExtensive website disclosure provides timely, accessible information that lowers investors’ uncertainty, thereby narrowing bid‑ask spreads. For private firms, a larger, more informative website signals firm quality and transparency, making them more attractive to equity investors and increasing the likelihood of private‑equity transactions. The mechanism is mediated by the volume and type of content (e.g., investor relations, product details) that directly addresses stakeholder information demands.\nResearch Design\nThe empirical strategy combines archival web data (Wayback Machine) with firm‑level financial and market data from COMPUSTAT, CRSP, IBES, Orbis, and Zephyr. The public‑firm sample includes 5,234 U.S. firms with 198,316 firm‑quarter observations (1997‑2020); the private‑firm sample comprises 2.8 million firms, with a subset of 371 French public firms. Website size is measured as the natural log of total bytes, and content shares are derived from bag‑of‑words analyses. Outcomes include the natural log of bid‑ask spreads and the probability of a private‑equity transaction. Estimation employs OLS regressions with year‑quarter, industry, and firm fixed effects, clustering standard errors at the firm or industry level, and controlling for established disclosure proxies.\nResults\nWebsite size is strongly positively correlated with management forecasts, voluntary 8‑K word counts, disclosure quality, and 10‑K file size, confirming its validity as a disclosure proxy. After controlling for firm, industry, and time effects, larger website size is associated with significantly lower bid‑ask spreads. Public‑firm regressions show that larger firms, B2B firms, and those with more analyst coverage have larger websites. For private firms, a 10 % increase in website size raises the probability of a 2019 equity transaction by approximately 2.6 %, a statistically significant elasticity. Compliance with the French Gender Equality Index is positively linked to higher website disclosure, with private firms exhibiting lower compliance but greater strategic prominence.\nConclusion\nThe study establishes company websites as a credible, informative disclosure channel that reduces information asymmetry and facilitates capital access, particularly for private firms. The findings suggest that firms should invest in comprehensive, stakeholder‑tailored web content, and that regulators might consider encouraging website disclosure as a complement to traditional filings. Future research could extend this framework to other jurisdictions and explore the causal impact of website disclosure on firm performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAI Generated Summary\n\n\n\nGenerated by Paper Summarizer using Ollama (Model: gpt-oss:20b)",

    "text": "Paper Summary\nIntroduction - The study investigates how EU firms that initiate antidumping investigations manipulate accounting data to influence tariff outcomes. - It finds that earnings management is widespread around the initiation of such investigations, especially when accounting data directly affect tariff magnitude, in cases with fewer petitioning firms, greater geographic distance, and high export ties to the accused country. - Raising equity or debt during the investigation moderates income‑decreasing earnings management. - No systematic difference in management by the level of a country’s legal enforcement or regulatory quality.\nLiterature Review - Prior research has linked stronger legal and regulatory institutions to reduced earnings management, but this study’s findings conflict with that literature. - The authors suggest the discrepancy may stem from differences in the earnings‑management incentives examined in earlier studies versus their own setting, which focuses on capital‑market pressures rather than broader firm incentives.\nData - The dataset combines the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (exports, GDP, etc.) with ORBIS financial data for EU firms that initiate antidumping investigations. - Injury‑elimination margin usage, number of petitioners, geographic distance, export exposure, and new financing status are key variables. - New financing is approximated using a 5 % total‑asset threshold based on the clean‑surplus relation; firms with &gt;5 % change in long‑term debt or equity relative to beginning‑period total assets are classified as new‑financing firms.\nMethodology - The study employs accrual‑based detection models (TOT ACC, WC ACC, etc.) and cross‑sectional tests for earnings management. - Regression specifications include a current‑period indicator, firm, country, and year fixed effects, with two‑way clustered standard errors (firm × year). - Sample partitions are based on injury‑elimination margin usage, number of petitioners, geographic distance, export exposure, new financing status, and legal enforcement/regulatory quality scores (AUDIT, ENFORCE, TOTAL). - Pseudoevent tests using years with extreme GDP changes confirm that earnings‑management patterns are not driven by economic shocks.\nResults - High‑use injury‑elimination‑margin cases: Current‑period discretionary accruals are significantly negative (e.g., –0.0200 *). - Low‑use injury‑elimination‑margin cases: Current‑period coefficients are insignificant. - Number of petitioners: Significant negative current‑period earnings‑management coefficients appear only in samples with few named petitioners; the effect disappears when many petitioners are involved. - Geographic distance: Earnings management is concentrated in cases where petitioners are geographically proximate. - Retaliation capacity: Firms in high‑retaliation‑capacity countries show significantly more negative current‑period accruals; low‑capacity firms exhibit no significant effect. - New financing: Firms that do not raise new financing over the two‑year period display significant negative discretionary accruals; those that do raise new financing do not. - Legal enforcement/regulatory quality**: No significant differences in earnings‑management patterns across high‑ and low‑score countries for AUDIT, ENFORCE, or TOTAL scores.\nDiscussion - The study’s sixth hypothesis yields a null result, yet coefficients of interest remain significant across samples, indicating sufficient statistical power. - The findings conflict with prior literature linking stronger legal and regulatory institutions to reduced earnings management, suggesting that better institutions may not curb all types of earnings manipulation. - The discrepancy may arise from differences in the earnings‑management incentives examined in earlier studies versus the capital‑market pressures focused on in this setting.\nConclusion - Regulatory forbearance may arise because regulators either do not constrain earnings management that benefits shareholders or focus only on income‑increasing management. - The relationship between legal/regulatory institutions and earnings management is ambiguous; better institutions may not curb all types of earnings manipulation. - Prior international studies may capture earnings informativeness rather than earnings management, reflecting different regulatory incentives.\nAppendix - No additional content provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAI Generated Summary\n\n\n\nGenerated by Paper Summarizer using Ollama (Model: gpt-oss:20b)",

    "text": "Paper Summary\nResearch Question\nThe paper investigates how longitudinal website data can be systematically harvested and leveraged to study organizational discourse and strategy. It addresses the knowledge gap that, despite the abundance of archived webpages, researchers lack a reliable, scalable pipeline and a comprehensive, open‑access database to conduct large‑scale, time‑series analyses of firm communication.\nContribution\nThe authors deliver an open‑source Python codebase that implements a four‑step scraping workflow—sample construction, Wayback Machine retrieval, preprocessing, and analysis—yielding the CompuCrawl database. This resource contains 11,277 North American firms, 86,303 firm‑year observations, and 1.6 million webpages (1996‑2020). The paper also demonstrates the database’s utility through a word‑embedding study of the evolving meaning of “sustainability,” and outlines future research avenues enabled by multimodal, historical web data.\nTheory\nThe study is grounded in data‑source theory (Landers et al., 2016), which guides the assessment of archival data suitability for research. It also draws on conceptual frameworks of organizational identity, distinctiveness, and strategic group formation, operationalized through topic modeling and word‑embedding techniques that capture semantic shifts over time.\nEconomic Mechanism\nWebsite content is treated as a proxy for organizational discourse; changes in the language and structure of webpages reflect shifts in strategic priorities and stakeholder communication. The causal logic posits that as firms evolve their public messaging—e.g., increasing emphasis on sustainability—their website text will exhibit measurable changes in word semantics and topic prevalence, which can be quantified through embeddings and topic models.\nResearch Design\nThe empirical approach combines archival data collection with advanced text analytics. Firm identifiers are drawn from Compustat North America; archived webpages are retrieved from the Wayback Machine for 1996‑2020. After rigorous cleaning (removal of invalid, non‑English, and short pages) and classification via GPT‑3.5, the authors aggregate front‑page and sub‑page texts into firm‑year observations. They then apply a correlated topic model (125 topics) and continuous bag‑of‑words word‑embedding models, aligning embeddings across five‑year periods with orthogonal Procrustes to track semantic evolution.\nResults\nThe CompuCrawl database contains 1,617,675 webpages and 636,318,656 words across 86,303 firm‑year observations. The word‑embedding analysis shows that the meaning of “sustainability” shifts markedly over time (cosine similarity rising from 0.301 in 2001‑2005 to 0.916 in 2016‑2020), whereas “profitability” remains stable (similarity &gt; 0.74 across all periods). Topic modeling yields 125 coherent topics, and GPT‑3.5 classification achieves a Krippendorff’s α of 0.79 against human coders. Coverage analysis indicates that missingness due to non‑archived websites is largely random and does not bias the sample.\nConclusion\nLongitudinal website data, when systematically harvested and processed, offers a rich, underexploited source for organizational research. The CompuCrawl database and accompanying codebase enable scholars to examine temporal changes in corporate discourse, identity, and strategic positioning at scale. The paper demonstrates that word‑embedding and topic‑modeling techniques can uncover meaningful semantic shifts, and it highlights future opportunities for multimodal analysis, generative‑AI classification, and comparative studies of strategic groups and distinctiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAI Generated Summary\n\n\n\nGenerated by Paper Summarizer using Ollama (Model: gpt-oss:20b)",

    "text": "2.1 Slide 3-4: Haans & Mertens (2024) – The Internet Never Forgets\n\n2.1.1 Introducing the Wayback Machine (Slide 3)\nThis paper provides the methodological backbone for all website-based research. The key insight is that the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine allows researchers to access historical snapshots of organizational websites—turning the web into a longitudinal data source.\nKey teaching points:\nThe Wayback Machine (archive.org) has been archiving web pages since 1996, currently holding over 850 billion archived page versions. This represents an unprecedented source of organizational data that captures voluntary disclosure choices firms make about themselves.\nPoint students to the screenshot on the slide. The “time banner” interface lets users navigate to any archived snapshot of a website. For research purposes, this means we can observe how firms presented themselves at different points in time—before and after events, across economic cycles, during regulatory changes.\nWhy this matters for accounting research:\nWebsites reveal what organizations choose to emphasize. Unlike mandated filings (10-Ks, 10-Qs), website content is largely voluntary. This makes it valuable for studying: corporate disclosure strategy, investor relations practices, CSR communication evolution, and strategic messaging to various stakeholders.\nThe CompuCrawl Database:\nHaans & Mertens don’t just provide a tutorial—they built and released an open-access database covering 11,277 North American Compustat firms from 1996-2020, with 86,303 firm-year observations and over 1.6 million webpages. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantCritical Point\n\n\n\nWebsite disclosure is voluntary and targeted at multiple audiences (not just investors). This distinguishes it from traditional disclosure measures based on regulatory filings.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Sample Selection & Coverage (Slide 4)\nThis slide addresses the elephant in the room: data quality and coverage limitations.\nSampling Steps (direct students to the Appendix button):\nThe four-step process (sample construction → data collection → processing → analysis) provides a template for any web scraping research project. Key decisions include: defining the research question, legal due diligence, determining scraping parameters, and cleaning/validating the data.\nCritical Findings on Coverage:\n\n~20% missingness rate: In any given year, approximately 20% of company websites are not archived by the Wayback Machine. This appears to be random rather than systematic—Haans & Mertens show that firm size, profitability, and visibility do not predict whether a website was archived.\nSurvivorship bias from Compustat: The database backfills successful firms, meaning early-period coverage may overrepresent eventual survivors.\nWebsite address changes not tracked: If a company changes its domain name, historical linkage can be lost. This is particularly problematic for firms undergoing rebranding or mergers.\nCoverage improves over time: Early years (1990s) have poor coverage; 2010+ is much better. This creates a temporal limitation for long-horizon studies.\n\nComparison to traditional data:\nThe authors benchmark website data coverage against common Compustat variables. Website coverage eventually exceeds that of net income in recent years—suggesting this data source is not inherently worse than traditional accounting data.\n\nDiscussion: What types of research questions might be particularly sensitive to the 20% annual missingness rate? When might it be acceptable versus problematic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTakeaway #1\n\n\n\nWebsite data offers unprecedented longitudinal access, BUT requires careful attention to coverage gaps and data quality. The ~20% random missingness and survivorship bias are real concerns that require explicit treatment in research design."

    "text": "2.2 Slide 5-6: Boulland et al. (2025) – Company Websites: A New Measure of Disclosure\n\n2.2.1 Research Question & Contributions (Slide 5)\nThis paper moves from “how to collect” to “what can we measure.” Boulland, Bourveau, and Breuer propose using company websites as a novel disclosure measure—particularly valuable for studying private firms and non-investor-targeted communication.\nMotivation:\nTraditional disclosure research focuses heavily on SEC filings, conference calls, and analyst interactions—all investor-centric channels available primarily for public firms. But firms communicate with many stakeholders (customers, employees, suppliers, regulators) through their websites. This channel has been largely ignored in academic research despite practitioners viewing it as essential.\nKey Contributions:\n\nProposes website size as a disclosure proxy: The primary measure is total website size in bytes, including text, media, and applications. Larger websites represent more disclosure.\nValidates against traditional measures: Website size correlates positively with management forecasts, voluntary 8-K filings, and disclosure quality measures—but is not subsumed by them.\nExtends to private firms: This is perhaps the most important contribution. Traditional disclosure measures simply don’t exist for private firms. Boulland et al. construct website-based measures for millions of U.S. private firms using Bureau van Dijk’s Orbis database.\nCross-country applicability: They demonstrate the measure works for French firms (public and private), opening possibilities for international research.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Measurement & Validation (Slide 6)\nHow they measure website disclosure:\n\nPrimary measure: Natural log of total website size in bytes\nContent categories: Products/Strategy/Processes (PSP), Investor Relations (IR), Geography, Human Resources—identified through URL string patterns\nComponents: Text, media (images/video), applications (PDFs, etc.)\n\nValidation approach (direct attention to Appendix):\nThe authors correlate their website-size measure with four established disclosure measures: management forecasts, disclosure quality (disaggregation of financial statements), voluntary 8-K filings, and 10-K file size. All correlations are positive and significant.\nMore importantly, they show website size is negatively associated with bid-ask spreads even after controlling for these traditional measures. If website disclosure were pure noise, we wouldn’t expect this incremental negative relationship with information asymmetry.\nApplications (Appendix slides):\n\nPrivate Equity Deals: For U.S. private firms, larger website size is associated with higher probability of receiving PE investment—consistent with disclosure reducing information asymmetry for potential investors.\nNonfinancial Disclosures in France: They examine compliance with a French mandate requiring firms to disclose Gender Equality Index scores on their websites. This showcases how website data can measure responses to non-financial disclosure regulations.\n\nThe Devil’s Advocate (important teaching moment):\nDirect students to the final Appendix slide on this paper. The low correlations between website size and traditional disclosure measures admit two interpretations:\n\nOptimistic: Websites capture different information—multi-stakeholder, real-time, voluntary—so low correlation is expected and desirable\nPessimistic: Low correlation reflects measurement noise, not true disclosure. Website size might capture marketing fluff rather than information content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTakeaway #2\n\n\n\nWebsite-based measures complement traditional disclosure metrics BUT validity questions remain. The measure’s strength (broad availability, multi-stakeholder focus) is also its weakness (less standardized, potentially noisy). Interpret with appropriate caution."

    "text": "2.5 Slide 9-12: Jones (1991) – Earnings Management During Import Relief Investigations\n\n2.5.1 Research Question & Main Finding (Slide 9)\nThe Research Question:\nDo firms that would benefit from import relief attempt to decrease earnings through earnings management during ITC investigations?\nThis is a specific, directional prediction—not just “do firms manage earnings?” but “do they manage earnings downward in a setting with clear incentives to appear injured?”\nThe Main Finding:\nManagers of domestic producers significantly decrease reported earnings during import relief investigations. Specifically:\n\nDiscretionary accruals are income-decreasing in the investigation year (Year 0)\nNo significant effect in surrounding years (-1, +1)\n\nThis temporal precision is crucial—it’s not that these firms always have low accruals, but that accruals are specifically low during the investigation period.\nMethodological Contribution:\nJones developed firm-specific time-series models to estimate “normal” accruals. The famous “Jones Model” for measuring discretionary accruals emerged from this paper. While subsequent research has modified and critiqued the model extensively (Modified Jones, performance-matching, Dechow-Dichev approach), the core insight—that abnormal accruals can proxy for earnings management—remains foundational.\nTheoretical Contribution:\nThis was one of the first studies examining income-decreasing earnings management. Prior work focused primarily on upward manipulation (bonus maximization, debt covenant avoidance, IPO pricing). Jones showed that when the incentive structure points downward, managers respond accordingly.\nThe paper also demonstrates that accounting numbers have economic consequences in regulatory settings—the ITC’s injury determination creates real wealth transfers (from consumers to domestic producers via tariffs/quotas).\n\nDiscussion: Why might income-decreasing earnings management be harder to detect than income-increasing manipulation? What monitoring mechanisms exist for each?\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Institutional Setting: Why This Is Clean (Slide 10)\nThe ITC Import Relief Process:\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission investigates claims that domestic producers are being injured by foreign imports. If injury is found, relief can include tariff increases or import quotas—substantial economic benefits for domestic producers.\nWhy profitability matters:\nCritically, profitability is an explicit factor in the ITC’s injury determination. The trade statute requires consideration of domestic industry financial health. This creates a direct link between accounting numbers and regulatory outcomes.\nPerfect Alignment of Incentives:\nThis is what makes the setting so clean for earnings management research:\n\nManagers want to appear injured → decrease earnings\nDebtholders tolerate lower earnings because they expect relief benefits to improve future cash flows\nShareholders benefit from relief → no resistance to downward management\nEmployees benefit from industry protection → aligned with management\nThe regulator doesn’t adjust: Jones’s interviews with ITC staff revealed they do NOT verify or adjust the audited financial statement data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantCritical Feature\n\n\n\n“The ITC does not verify any information in the audited financial statements or 10-Ks, nor do they make any adjustments to these data… The ITC does not attempt to adjust the financial data for accounting procedures used or for accrual decisions made by the firms’ managers.”\n\n\nThis quote (from Jones’s paper) is essential. Unlike many regulatory settings where sophisticated monitors might adjust for manipulation, the ITC took accounting numbers at face value.\n\n\n2.5.3 Sample Industries (Slide 11)\nFive Industries, Six Investigations (1980-1985):\nJones studied “escape clause” investigations (Section 201 of the Trade Act)—cases where domestic producers seek relief from increased imports. The industries were: automobiles, copper, carbon steel, footwear, and stainless steel.\nPoint students to the table showing the specific investigations and their timing.\nSample Characteristics:\n\n23 firms with complete Compustat data\nFirms had broad product lines (material to consolidated financials)\nExcluded: foreign-owned subsidiaries, firms opposing relief, diversified conglomerates, firms with insufficient time-series data\n\nThe sample is small by modern standards, but the power comes from the clean identification, not sample size.\n\n\n2.5.4 Hypothesis Development (Slide 12)\nMain Hypothesis:\nManagers make accounting choices that reduce reported earnings during investigation periods compared to non-investigation periods.\nAddressing Potential Concerns:\nConflicting incentives: Usually managers want to increase earnings (bonus plans, debt covenants, stock price). Jones argues the import relief benefit dominates these concerns because: (1) the stakes are high, (2) debtholders are willing to waive covenants given expected relief benefits, and (3) future earnings are expected to improve post-relief.\nFree-rider problem: If one firm manipulates but others don’t, the manipulating firm still benefits from industry-wide relief. Solution: Jones conducts supplemental tests using only petitioner firms—those that bore the cost of filing the petition—who have the strongest incentives.\n\n\n2.5.5 Empirical Results (Slide 13)\nThe Jones Model:\n\\[\\frac{\\text{Total accruals}_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} = \\frac{1}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_1 \\frac{\\Delta REV_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_2 \\frac{PPE_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nThe model captures “normal” accruals as a function of revenue growth (accruals for receivables, inventory) and PPE (depreciation). The residual is the “discretionary” component.\nKey Results:\n\nYear -1: Discretionary accruals not significantly different from zero\nYear 0 (investigation): Significantly income-decreasing (t-statistic = -5.008)\nYear +1: Not significantly different from zero\n\nThis pattern is exactly what the hypothesis predicts—manipulation occurs specifically during the investigation window.\nRobustness:\n\nPortfolio tests control for cross-sectional correlation (firms in the same industry investigated simultaneously)\nResults hold when each industry is omitted one at a time (four-industry t-statistics range from -3.635 to -5.035)\nPetitioner subsample shows consistent results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Implication\n\n\n\nManagers systematically manipulate accruals downward specifically during investigation periods. The temporal precision—effects in Year 0 but not surrounding years—provides strong support for the earnings management hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Why This Design Is Pretty Darn Good (Slide 14)\nClear Incentive Alignment:\n\nRegulatory rule explicitly uses accounting profitability\nAll contracting parties benefit from appearing injured\nRegulator doesn’t adjust for earnings management\n\nPowerful Research Design:\n\nTime-series control for firm-specific “normal” accruals\nClear prediction: decrease in investigation year only\nMultiple industries, multiple years\nAddresses free-rider problem with petitioner subsample\n\nWhat makes this setting rare:\nMost earnings management settings involve competing incentives and sophisticated monitors. Here, everyone is on the same side, and the regulator is unsophisticated. This creates an almost textbook-perfect setting for detecting manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConnection to Part 2\n\n\n\n“Jones’s 1991 paper is now 35 years old. The setting remains as clean as ever—ITC investigations still occur, profitability still matters for injury determination. But now we have website data. What might firms communicate on their websites during import relief investigations? And do those communications correlate with their accruals management?”"

    "text": "3.2 Phase 1: The Replication Journey\n\n3.2.1 Slide 16: What I Set Out to Replicate\nJones (1991) Main Finding:\n\nIncome-decreasing discretionary accruals in Year 0\nClean institutional setting\nTime-series firm-specific estimation\n\nMy Approach:\n\nCross-sectional industry-specific (pooled) estimation\nModern sample (1980-2020)\nStacked difference-in-differences design\n\nWhy cross-sectional instead of time-series?\nThis is a key methodological choice to explain. Jones estimated separate regressions for each firm using their full history. I estimate industry-year regressions using all firms in that industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\nJones Original\nMy Replication\n\n\n\n\nEstimation approach\nTime-series (firm-specific)\nCross-sectional (industry)\n\n\nData requirements\nLong firm history\nIndustry observations\n\n\nWhat it controls for\nFirm-specific effects\nIndustry dynamics\n\n\nStatistical power\nLower (fewer obs/firm)\nHigher (pooled data)\n\n\nParameter interpretation\nFirm-specific “normal”\nIndustry-specific “normal”\n\n\n\nTrade-offs:\nCross-sectional estimation gains statistical power but assumes all firms in an industry have similar accrual processes. This may be reasonable for firms in the same competitive environment but loses firm-specific variation that Jones exploited.\n\n\n3.2.2 Slide 17: The Timing Problem I Had to Solve\nThe Problem:\nFiscal years ≠ calendar years ≠ investigation dates. This creates ambiguity about which fiscal year constitutes “Year 0.”\nExample:\nInvestigation announced: June 1985 (calendar)\nFirm fiscal year ends: December 1984\nFirm fiscal year ends: December 1985\nWhich \"year\" is Year 0?\nIf a firm’s fiscal year ends before the investigation announcement, their Year 0 financials were already set before they knew about the investigation. If the fiscal year ends after the announcement, they had time to adjust.\nMy Solution:\ntime = case_when(\n  # Fiscal year ends before investigation decision\n  fyear == event_year & month(datadate) &lt; year_zero_month ~ time,\n  # Fiscal year ends after investigation decision - shift time\n  TRUE ~ time + 1\n)\nThis code adjusts event time based on whether the firm’s fiscal year-end fell before or after the investigation announcement month.\nWhy This Matters—A Key Insight:\nWhen I first ran the analysis without this adjustment, effects appeared in Years -2 to -1 rather than Year 0. This “discrepancy” isn’t a bug—it reveals that firms may manage earnings in anticipation of investigations. The fiscal year overlap means some “Year -1” observations actually capture post-announcement manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKey Insight\n\n\n\nThe timing “discrepancy” isn’t a bug—it’s a feature revealing that firms may manage earnings in anticipation of investigations.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Slide 18: Finding and Linking the Investigations\nThe Problem:\nThe USITC conducts many types of investigations. Which ones match Jones’s setting?\n\nSeveral investigation types: Safeguard, Antidumping, Countervailing Duty\nJones used “Escape Clause” cases (Section 201)—a subset of Safeguard investigations\nShe selected only investigations “pertaining to a broad product line”\n\nMy Approach:\nI scraped the USITC Commission Publications Library and matched investigation titles to SIC codes using:\n\nSIC-NAICS crosswalk (1987/1997 versions)\nSemantic matching via local language model (for ambiguous cases)\nManual verification of key matches\n\nFigures to reference:\n\nTop 5 investigation subjects (histogram)\nTreatment cohorts over time (histogram)\n\nWhy this matters:\nInvestigation type affects incentives and sample selection. If the industry represents a small portion of consolidated sales, incentives to manage earnings are weaker. Jones specifically excluded diversified firms for this reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKey Insight\n\n\n\nInstitutional knowledge is key here. There is very much room for improvement in matching investigations to affected industries. Knowledge of investigation types is crucial for sample selection and interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Slide 19: Live Demo – Replication Results\n[SWITCH TO GITHUB PAGE: revisiting-jones.qmd]\nWalk students through:\n\nSample construction & coverage: How many investigations? How many firm-years? What’s the sample composition over time?\nSummary statistics: Point out the key variables—total accruals, discretionary accruals (Jones residuals), firm size, treatment indicator.\nFirst-difference DiD estimates: This table compares changes in discretionary accruals between treated and control industries for each event-year window.\n\nThe coefficient on “Treated” in Year 0 should be negative and significant\nPre-period coefficients (Year -2, -1) test parallel trends\nPost-period coefficient (Year +1) checks for reversal\n\nEvent-study visualization: The DiD-style plot shows coefficient estimates across event time. Look for:\n\nFlat pre-trends\nSharp drop at Year 0\nPossible reversal in Year +1\n\n\nReference Jones Table 5:\nPoint to the image of Jones’s original results table. Key comparison points:\n\nHer Year 0 t-statistic: -5.008\nHer effect magnitude: ~5.85% of lagged assets (mean abnormal accruals)\n\nHow do our estimates compare?\n\n\n3.2.5 Slide 20: Replication Takeaways\nWhat Worked:\n\n✓ Jones findings are robust to modern methods\n✓ Cross-sectional approach provides adequate power\n✓ Timing issue resolved with fiscal year alignment\n✓ Effects are economically and statistically significant\n\nOpen Questions:\n\nWould time-series give identical results?\n\nWe have enough observations per firm to test this\nNeed to identify firms from original ITC reports (possibly automate with LLM?)\n\nThe earnings management literature has advanced:\n\nDechow et al. (2010) reviews many model variants\nBreuer (2023) proposes Bayesian combination of multiple EM measures\nChen et al. (2018, 2023) critique two-step estimation approaches\n\nWhy do effects appear in Year -1 to Year 0?\n\nIs this anticipation? Fiscal year overlap? Accrual reversal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThe Bigger Question\n\n\n\nReplication is validating, but not publishable. What NEW insight can we add 35 years later?"

Maybe. But I have five serious concerns that could kill this project.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Slide 25: What Keeps Me Up at Night\nWalk through each concern seriously—this models how to evaluate project viability.\nConcern #1: Measurement Validity\nAre keywords capturing “strategic injury narrative” or just “we’re in an investigation”?\n\nCrude keyword counts miss nuance, sentiment, context\nMay need sophisticated NLP (FinBERT, topic modeling)\nRisk of false positives: mentioning “competition” ≠ claiming injury\n\nConcern #2: Wayback Coverage & Timing\nOnly later firm-years have snapshots available. When do websites actually get updated?\n\nNon-random missingness could bias inference\nCoverage especially poor for 1980s-1990s cases\nUnlike 10-Ks (predictable timing), websites update unpredictably\n\nConcern #3: Attribution Problem\nWebsites are controlled by whom? CFO? Marketing? Compliance?\n\nIf marketing controls content → not earnings management strategy\nIf compliance requirement → mechanical response, not strategic\nNeed to establish CFO involvement for EM interpretation\n\nConcern #4: Spurious Correlation\nIs any website-accruals-investigation correlation real or just noise?\n\nMultiple testing concerns\nSensitivity to keyword choices\nSmall sample in overlapping period\n\nConcern #5: Using different EM measures & addressing 2-stage critique?\nThe literature has moved beyond simple Jones residuals.\n\nChen et al. (2018, 2023) critique two-step approaches\nBreuer (2023) Bayesian framework for combining measures\nReal earnings management (Roychowdhury 2006) as alternative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningReality Check\n\n\n\nAny ONE of these could sink the project. Are they fixable, or fatal?"

Profitability remains an explicit injury factor. However, the regulatory environment has evolved—worth checking current ITC practices.\nQ: Isn’t keyword frequency analysis too simple?\nA: Yes, but it’s a valid first pass. If there’s no signal with crude measures, sophisticated NLP probably won’t find one either. Start simple, then refine."
