    "text": "Sample Selection\n\nMatching Import Relief Investigations to Industries and Compustat Firms\nI identify import relief investigations from the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) by scraping their Commission Publications Library. My scraping process employs robust retry logic and Cloudflare bypass mechanisms, with raw HTML cached for reproducibility and efficiency. I match investigation titles to standardized industry classifications using a SIC-NAICS crosswalk (1987/1997 versions) enhanced by semantic matching via a local language model. This procedure links (almost) each USITC investigation ID to corresponding SIC and NAICS codes, enabling systematic identification of treatment industries (those under investigation) and control industries (structurally similar but not investigated). For implementation details, see the companion Python scripts. The table below summarizes the matched import relief investigations and their corresponding industries.\n\n\n\n\nMatched Import Relief Investigations and Corresponding Industries\n\n\nInvestigation Title\nSIC Title\nSIC Code\nLLM Reasoning\n\n\n\n\nCrystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells\nNonclassifiable Establishments\n9999\nNone of the listed industries correspond to photovoltaic cell manufacturing;

therefore the nonclassifiable category is chosen.\n\n\nExtruded Rubber Thread\nMolded, Extruded, and Lathe-Cut Mechanical Rubber Goods\n3061\nThe product is an extruded rubber thread, matching the description of Molded, Extruded, and Lathe-Cut Mechanical Rubber Goods and its NAICS counterpart for rubber products manufactured for mechanical use.\n\n\nFresh Winter Tomatoes\nFresh Fruits and Vegetables\n5148\nThe title refers to fresh tomatoes, directly matching the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables industry and its wholesale distribution.\n\n\nBroom Corn Brooms\nBrooms and Brushes\n3991\nThe title refers to manufacturing brooms, matching the Brooms and Brushes industry.\n\n\nFresh Tomatoes and Bell Peppers\nFresh Fruits and Vegetables\n5148\nThe case title references fresh produce (tomatoes and bell peppers), matching the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables wholesaler industry.\n\n\nWheat Gluten\nWheat\n111\nWheat gluten is a product derived directly from wheat, so the most appropriate industry is wheat farming.\n\n\nLamb Meat\nMeat Markets\n5421\nThe title refers to retail sale of lamb meat, matching Meat Markets.\n\n\nSteel Wire Rod\nSteel Wire Drawing\n3315\nDirect match to steel wire drawing, which produces wire rods.\n\n\nCertain Circular Welded Carbon Quality Line Pipe\nSteel Pipe and Tubes\n3317\nThe product is a welded carbon-quality line pipe, which is a steel pipe manufactured from purchased steel.\n\n\nCrabmeat from Swimming Crabs\nNonclassifiable Establishments\n9999\nNo provided industry relates to seafood or crab processing, so the case falls into the nonclassifiable/unclassified category.\n\n\nExtruded Rubber Thread\nMolded, Extruded, and Lathe-Cut Mechanical Rubber Goods\n3061\nThe title indicates extruded rubber threads, which are mechanical rubber goods produced by extrusion, matching SIC 3061 and NAICS 326291.\n\n\nSteel: Determinations and Views of Commissioners\nSteel Foundries, NEC\n3325\nThe case concerns the steel industry in general, best aligning with steel foundry manufacturing.\n\n\nCrystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells\nNonclassifiable Establishments\n9999\nNo industry in the list matches photovoltaic cell manufacturing; select the nonclassifiable/unclassified category.\n\n\nLarge Residential Washers\nBolts, Nuts, Screws, Rivets, and Washers\n3452\nThe only industry listed that explicitly mentions washers is Bolt, Nut, Screw, Rivet, and Washer Manufacturing, making it the closest match.\n\n\nFresh\nFresh Fruits and Vegetables\n5148\nThe title 'Fresh' directly matches the description of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Wholesalers.\n\n\nFine Denier Polyester Staple Fiber\nBroadwoven Fabric Mills, Manmade Fiber and Silk\n2221\nPolyester staple fiber is a manmade fiber used in broadwoven fabric manufacturing, matching the Broadwoven Fabric Mills industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantSome important caveats about the matching process:\n\n\n\n\nI only use safeguard investigations (not other types of import relief)\nSome investigations could not be matched to a specific SIC code (9999)\nThe matching relies on LLM reasoning which may introduce errors\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting Data\nI obtain financial statement data from Compustat North America for U.S. incorporated firms beginning in 1975. I exclude financial institutions (SIC codes 6000-6999) and require non-missing total assets for all firm-years. To ensure robust industry-specific estimation of the Jones model, I retain only industry-years (three-digit SIC level) with at least 10 observations. I exclude observations with missing values for total accruals, revenue changes, property-plant-equipment, or lagged total assets. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the influence of extreme outliers. For additional implementation details, see the companion R script.\n\n\nTreatment Sample Selection and Event Window Definition\nTo construct my treatment sample, I apply several critical filters to the matched investigations. First, I identify the investigation date and extract both the calendar year and month. To ensure that year_zero captures the last complete fiscal year before the investigation announcement, I adjust for each firm’s fiscal year-end month. Specifically, for firms with fiscal year-end months before the investigation month, their fiscal year statement would have already been reported before the investigation, making that fiscal year “year 0.” For firms with fiscal year-end months after the investigation month, their reported year 0 encompasses the investigation announcement, and I adjust their timing accordingly. Second, I address the issue of multiple investigations in the same industry. Some SIC-3 industries (314, 332, 514) experience multiple import relief investigations within short time windows. To avoid contamination and confounded treatment effects, I retain only the first investigation per SIC-3 industry, excluding subsequent treatments within the same year or immediately following year (diff_year_zero &gt; 1). This design choice prioritizes clean identification of the initial shock at the cost of sample size—a conservative approach that trades statistical power for causal credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OG… Jones Model\n\nJones (1991): Time-Series Firm-Specific Approach\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Total accruals}_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} = \\frac{1}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_1 \\frac{\\Delta REV_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\beta_2 \\frac{PPE_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1}} + \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Total accruals}_{it}}{AT_{i,t-1\\) = total accruals for firm i at time t\n\\(AT_{i,t-1}\\) = total assets for firm i at time t-1\n\\(\\Delta REV_{it}\\) = change in revenues for firm i at time t\n\\(PPE_{it}\\) = property, plant, and equipment for firm i at time t\n\nJones (1991) estimates a separate regression for each firm using several years of historical data. The estimation period stops in year t-2. Firm-specific coefficients capture each firm’s unique accrual patterns. Compares actual accruals to the firm’s own historical norm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantTime-Series Firm-Specific Jones Model\n\n\n\nDiscretionary accruals: \\(\\text{DA}}_{it}\\) = residual from firm i’s time-series regression\n\n\n\n\nMy Approach: Cross-Sectional Industry-Specific Approach\nEstimates yearly regressions by SIC-3 industry using all firms in that industry. Industry-year-specific coefficients capture industry norms in each period. Compares firm accruals to industry peers in the same year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantCross-Sectional Industry-Specific Jones Model\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{DA}_{it}\\) = residual from industry-year cross-sectional regression\nImplication: I measure abnormal accruals relative to contemporaneous industry peers, not firm’s historical pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDeep Dive: Earnings Management Measurement\n\n\n\nDechow et al. (2010) reviews the literature surrounding “earnings quality,” including earnings management. They discuss trade-offs between time-series and cross-sectional approaches to measuring abnormal accruals. See Gow and Ding (2024) for an in-depth overview of implementing accrual-based earnings management measures—or for practical guidance on many aspects of empirical research in accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked Difference-in-Differences with First-Differenced Specification\nI implement a stacked difference-in-differences (DiD) design to estimate the impact of import relief investigations on discretionary accruals. The treatment group consists of firms in industries subject to import relief investigations, while the control group includes firms in industries without such investigations (different SIC-1 codes). I define event time relative to the investigation year, with t=0 as the investigation year. For each event window (t-2 to t+2), I create a separate dataset stacking observations from treated and control industries; see, e.g., Baker et al. (2022); Baker et al. (2025) for more details on stacked DiD designs.\n\nFirst-Difference DiD Model\n\\[\\Delta \\text{DA}_{it} = \\beta_1Treated_i + \\alpha_{fyear}+ \\gamma_{cohort}+ \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta(DA_{it}) = \\text{DA}_{it} - \\text{DA}_{i,t-1}\\) is the change in discretionary accruals for firm i at time t\n\\(Treated_i\\) is a binary indicator for whether firm i is in the treatment group\n\\(\\alpha_{fyear}\\) are fixed effects for the fiscal year\n\\(\\gamma_{cohort}\\) are fixed effects for the cohort\n\\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is the error term\n\n\n\nWhy?\nThe idea is to present results in a way that is more directly comparable to Jones (1991). She also compares changes in discretionary accruals around the investigation period, specifically in years t-1 to t+1. I want to make my results more directly comparable to hers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOkay, so where’s the DiD?\n\n\n\nDifference #1: Change in discretionary accruals within firms over time. First differencing removes firm fixed effects.\nDifference #2: Difference in changes between treated and control industries over time. The coefficient on \\(Treated_i\\) captures the average difference in changes in discretionary accruals between treated and control industries.",

(2010) fot an overview - Breuer and Schütt (2023) provides a Bayesian framework to combine multiple earnings management measures into a single latent construct - To go even further, one could consider real earnings management measures as in Roychowdhury (2006) (better leave that up to Reviewer 2 to decide for you…) - While you are at it, also check and apply Srivastava (2019) for improved measurement of real earnings management (I see you, Reviewer 2…)\n\n\nResiduals as Dependent Variable\n\nDiscretionary accruals are estimated residuals from the Jones model (two-step approach)\nChen et al.

We’ll examine Jennifer Jones’s influential 1991 study on earnings management during import relief investigations, then see how contemporary website data could extend and validate her findings.\nThe lecture is structured in two parts:\nPart 1: Three Papers introduces the methodological toolkit and theoretical foundation:\n\nOverview: Modern web scraping techniques for longitudinal data collection based on Haans and Mertens (2024)\nWebsite-based disclosure measures and their validation based on Boulland et al. (2025)\nThe classic Jones (1991) earnings management study\n\nPart 2: Research in Action demonstrates the research process:\n\nMy interpretation of Jones (1991) with modern methods\nPreliminary exploration of website disclosure patterns during investigations\nStructured critique and discussion of research design choices\n\nBeyond understanding specific methods and findings, this lecture aims to stimulate your own research creativity. By engaging with the materials—seeing how papers can be combined, observing the decision-making process, and practicing structured critique—you’ll develop pattern recognition for spotting research opportunities. The GitHub repository provides working code and data that you can adapt for your own questions, and the lecture format encourages you to think: “What would I do differently?” or “Where else could this approach work?”"
